TwitterSentiment
=================
TwitterSentiment Analysis application.

Overview
========
An application that analyzes the sentiments of Twitter Tweets and categorizes them as either positive, negative or neutral.

Twitter Configuration
=====================
In order to utilize the TweetCollector flowlet, which pulls a small sample stream via the Twitter API, the API key and Access token must be configured.
Follow the steps at the following page to obtain these credentials: [Twitter oauth access tokens](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens).
These configurations must be provided as runtime arguments to the flow prior to starting it, in order to use the TweetCollector flowlet. To avoid this, see the "disable.public" argument option below.

Flow Runtime Arguments
======================
When start the ```analysis``` flow from the UI, runtime arguments can be specified.
"disable.public" - Specify any value for this key in order to disable the source flowlet ```TweetCollector```.
"oauth.consumerKey" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.
"oauth.consumerSecret" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.
"oauth.Token" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.
"oauth.TokenSecret" - See ```Twitter Configuration``` above.
